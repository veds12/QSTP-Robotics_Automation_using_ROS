# Week 4

Welcome to Week 4. This week we will focus on path planning alogrithms and how to use them to automate robots. 

The main aims for this week are -

1. Understand graphs and path planning using the Djikstra algorithm
2. Understand sampling based path planning algorithms - specifically RRT
3. Be able to implement a simple sampling based path planner

There are many different path planning algorithms, and this is an area of active research. We will be focusing on certain fundamental techniques within the field, but feel free to look around, read papers and explore the field further by yourself.
